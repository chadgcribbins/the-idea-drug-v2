The data centre industry produces enormous amounts of waste heat. Most of it is simply vented into the atmosphere — an extraordinary waste of energy in a world desperate for sustainable solutions.

Elchemy is changing that. By capturing and recycling heat from data centres, they're turning a waste product into a valuable resource. The technology isn't new — what's new is the business model and the will to make it work at scale.

This is exactly the kind of hypothesis-led innovation we champion at System Two. Not an idea looking for a problem, but a deep understanding of a real need, tested and validated through rigorous experimentation.
