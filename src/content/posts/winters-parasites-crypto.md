Crypto winters are fascinating not because of the financial carnage, but because of what they reveal about human behaviour under uncertainty.

When prices collapse, the tourists leave. What remains is a smaller, more focused group of builders who were never in it for the speculation. This is the parasitic relationship between speculation and genuine innovation — the speculator feeds on the builder's work, but the builder survives the winter.

Climate change operates on a similar dynamic. The urgency creates opportunity for genuine innovators, but it also attracts idea-tourists who confuse enthusiasm with evidence. The antidote, as always, is hypotheses over ideas, evidence over enthusiasm.
